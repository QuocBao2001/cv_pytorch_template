# PyTorch Computer Vision Model Training Template

![Project Status: In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-In%20Progress-yellow)

Welcome to the PyTorch Computer Vision Model Training Template! This template is designed to provide a structured framework for training computer vision models using PyTorch. Please note that the project is currently a work in progress and not yet complete. 

Suggestions, and feedback are highly appreciated.

## Project Overview

This project aims to streamline the process of training computer vision models using PyTorch. It provides a well-organized folder structure and basic files to get you started with your computer vision tasks.

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

- `config/`: This folder contains configuration and hyperparameter files for your models. You can define different configurations for various experiments here.

- `datasets/`: Here, you can declare PyTorch dataset classes. This folder is intended to hold your dataset-related code.

- `models/`: You can store your PyTorch neural network models in this folder. Different model architectures can be defined and implemented here.

- `utils/`: This folder is meant to store utility functions, helper scripts, or any other code snippets that assist in various parts of the project.

- `infer.py`: This script is used for making inferences with your trained models. It provides an example of how to load a trained model and perform inference on new data.

- `test.py`: Use this script to run tests, evaluate models, and perform validation on your dataset.

- `train.py`: This script is the heart of the training process. You'll define the training loop and other related functions here.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure:** Customize the configuration files in the `config/` folder to match your experiment settings and hyperparameters.

4. **Define Datasets:** Implement your dataset classes in the `datasets/` folder. You can follow the provided template or structure your datasets as needed.

5. **Create Models:** Design your neural network models in the `models/` folder. You can create different architectures and variations based on your experiment requirements.

6. **Training:** Fill in the training logic within the `train.py` script. Define the training loop, data loading, loss functions, and optimization steps.

7. **Testing and Inference:** Use the `test.py` and `infer.py` scripts to evaluate your models and make predictions, respectively.
